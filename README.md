All the code for the app is in the file Pytube_downloader, everything else belogs to the executable made with PyInstaller.

The .exe can be moved freely around your PC, but be aware that wherever it's, two new folders will be created (Music and Video).

No need to install anything, just run the pytube_downloader.exe
